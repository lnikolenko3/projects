Main inspration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)
Rules:
Snake costantly moves in a given direction. You can change the direction of its movement by pressing left/right/
up/down. Snake can not go in the opposite direction of its movement (a.k.a if the snake is going right, you
cannot make it go left instantly). Snake cannot go beyond borders of the screen and cannot go higher that the red 
line on top of the screen. Also, snake cannot bump into itself. To score points, snake has to collect apples that 
can be located anywhere on the screen. Once the snake eats an apple it gets bigger so maneuvering gets trickier each
time. The objective is to collect as many points as you can and or achieve the maximum length (whichever you do first). If the snake bumps into borders or into itself it loses a live and you start from you initial length, but your score is kept. Once you lose all lives you get a game over and see your final score. If you restart a game after a game over, the score will be reset to 0.
The game launches to the title screen. In order to go from title screen to the game press A. If you want to go back
to the title screen at any point in the game press select key(your score will be reset to 0).
The player wins the game if the length of the snale will be greater than 30.
