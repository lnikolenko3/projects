# Legoman Animation #
This is an animation done in [Processing](https://processing.org/), that captures a brave legoman doing a life-threating skateboard stunt (not that life-threatening, but you get the idea). I utilized matrix stack for coding this animation, to ensure that the legoman won't lose his limbs during his jump :)

**_Note:_** the animation file is rather large, so the gif in this README might get stuck at times, but the original animation in Processing IDE is perfectly fine.  
## How do I run it in Processing? ##
I tried my best to capture the animation in the gif file above, but just in case you want to see the original sketch and play around, I will briefly go over the required software. So, you need to dowload [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) and install [Python Mode for Processing](http://py.processing.org/). The installation will be super easy, UNLESS your path to your sketchbook location has letters from any language other than English. If this happens to be the case, your sketch simply will not run and Processing will give you little to no feedback, so yeah, don't do that. After you are all set with Python Mode, just open .pyde file in Processing and click "Play".
