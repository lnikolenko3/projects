Movie Description:
We start the movie by stating that the movie is for adult only, a joke of course! We then proceed to the next
sceen where the robot, a persona of a student, notices a beer at the college of business. The robot after innocently 
noticing the beer gives into temptation and proceed to drink the beer, much to his delight. We then transition to
the sceen where the robot pays the price for his for his mass conpsumption of beer by having a hangover. The sceen
give a first person point of view showing the robot suffering from his hangover. The screen effects is a combination
of split screen blinking and fade to black. Notice everything is spinning for the robot and he finally passes out.
The next day we see the robot and he again notices a beer at the college of business. Having learned his lesson from 
the previous nights hangover warning light of red go off in the mind of the robot and he decideds that he would
rather study than consume beer. Sundance here we come!

Deviations:
We have two filming codes, because our movie includes "first person perspective" and "third person perspective". 
Our performance codes are incorporated inside of the filming codes. We have two filming codes and as a result, 
we have two separate performance codes.
We also have two acting codes. One code contols the robot manaully and the other - automatically.  
In the movie robot was controlled manually,but it turned out that we have to make it possible
for other people to reproduce the movie, so we came up with an acting code 2 that replays all the
movements done by a robot in a movie using manual control.
