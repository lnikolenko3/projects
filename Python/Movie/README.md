# Movie #
 This is a video that was made with the use of programmable [Scribbler 2 (S2) Robot](https://www.parallax.com/product/28136) and 
[IPRE Fluke2 Add-On Board](http://www.betterbots.com/cshop/fluke2). The filming, robot movement and special effects 
in the video were manually programmed in Python. Here is a screenshot from the video:
