# Mailbox #
I have created a JavaFx application that gets email from the bogus server and displays them to the user. You can move messages to trash, flag them and sort your emails by date, sender and subject.

## How do I run it? ##
You compile the app by running ```javac MailReader.java``` and then run it with ```java MailReader```.
