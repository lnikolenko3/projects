# AVL Tree Implementation #
I have implemented and [AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) - a self balancing binary tree, that balances itself after every 
insertion or deletion, and, therefore, ensures worst-case O(log n) complexity, while a regular binary search tree can become a linked 
list with worst case O(n) complexity.   
I really like this project, because it helped to fully understand recursion and its application in the Data Structures scope.
