### An app developed at #HackGT 2015 ###  
Security is an important aspect of our lives, one that often goes overlooked. Having a strong password is essential in maintaining account security, but at the end of the day, it's hard/time-consuming for users to remember and input these sorts of passwords.

So we made an extension that simplifies password generation and entry for you. Our extension can take any easy to remember password, turn it into a complex 16 character long string, and automatically paste it into any password form field.

We also implemented a picture password feature. You can use any picture from your computer and have that act as your password. The entire app is localized to each machine; your passwords aren't stored on any database and is rather generated each time you use the extension.

We used the SHA - 256 algorithm to generate these complex strings. The project is written in Javascript.
