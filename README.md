# Welcome to my repo! #
Dear guest/fellow student/recruiter/curious individual!  
I am thrilled that you decided to check out this repository. I am a rising Computer Science senior in Georgia 
Instute of Technology. I am a backend developer and my strogest languages are C, Java and Python. I have been coding since I started college (a.k.a. about 3 years) and my CS interests are a little bit all over the place: Networking, Gaming and Animation, Computer Security. I am also starting to get my feet into Machine Learning and AI, because it has been a hot topic for a while now and many people I know think that this is the next big thing coming up in Computer Science. 
This is the place where I upload some of the things I have done in school and on my own. Even though I put love and effort into every single project on this page, I definitely have favorite ones that you should look at first:
Markup: 
* A [Snake Game](https://github.com/lnikolenko/projects/tree/master/C) written in C for GameBoy Advanced
* A [Legoman Animation](https://github.com/lnikolenko/projects/tree/master/Python/Legoman%20Animation/p2a_object) coded in Python
* A [Firefox Extension](https://github.com/lnikolenko/projects/tree/master/JavaScript/Firefox%20extension) designed to generate secure passwords for you, written in JavaScript
